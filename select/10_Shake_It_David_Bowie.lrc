[00:27.64] I feel like a sail-boat
[00:32.04] Adrift on the sea
[00:36.12] It's a brand new day
[00:39.96] So when you gonna phone me
[00:52.96] 
[00:52.68] I could take you to heaven
[00:56.96] I could spin you to hell
[01:00.79] But I'll take you to New York
[01:05.07] It's the place that I know well
[01:20.57] 
[01:23.65] Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
[01:35.88] And I wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well
[02:06.88] 
[01:40.84] Duck and I sway - what's my line
[01:45.02] Shoot at a full moon - what's my line
[01:49.32] So what's my line - shake it baby
[02:05.82] 
[01:59.18] Cause love is the answer
[02:03.87] Love's talking to me
[02:07.54] I'd scream and I'll fight for you
[02:11.86] You're better than money
[02:23.86] 
[02:29.96] We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
[02:41.74] When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
[03:10.24] 
[02:53.60] Shake it baby
[02:57.36] Ah shake it shake it
[02:59.31] I duck and I sway - what's my line
[03:03.47] I shoot at a full moon - what's my line
[03:07.93] So what's my line - shake it shake it baby
[03:14.28] Shake shake it
[03:23.01] Shake it baby
[03:26.84] Shake shake it
[03:35.72] Shake it baby
[03:39.21] Shake it shake it
